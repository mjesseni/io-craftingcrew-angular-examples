# Common Pitfalls Developers Face When Implementing Angular Applications

## 1. **Not Using Angular CLI Efficiently**
Many developers don't fully utilize the Angular CLI, which provides scaffolding, code generation, and tooling.

### Why It Is a Problem
Manually creating components, modules, or services can lead to inconsistent file structures, missing configurations, and wasted time.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using Angular CLI ensures uniformity, generates boilerplate code quickly, and reduces the chance of human error.

### Example:
Instead of manually creating a component:
```bash
ng generate component my-component
```
Using CLI ensures consistent file structures and reduces errors.

## 2. **Neglecting Reactive Forms for Complex Forms**
Using template-driven forms for large, complex forms can become unmanageable.

### Why It Is a Problem
Template-driven forms lack scalability and become harder to validate and debug as the complexity increases.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Reactive forms provide better structure, are easier to validate dynamically, and allow full control over form state and validation logic.

### Example:
**Reactive Form:**
```typescript
const myForm = this.fb.group({
  name: ['', Validators.required],
  email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]]
});
```

---

## 3. **Not Managing State Effectively**
State management becomes chaotic without a structured approach, especially in large apps.

### Why It Is a Problem
When state is managed ad hoc, debugging becomes difficult, and the app's behavior becomes unpredictable.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
State management libraries like NgRx provide a clear and predictable flow of data, making the application easier to debug and scale.

### Solution:
Use NgRx for predictable state management:
```typescript
// Example Action
export const loadItems = createAction('[Items] Load Items');

// Example Reducer
export const itemsReducer = createReducer(initialState,
  on(loadItems, state => ({ ...state, loading: true }))
);
```

## 4. **Subscribing Without Unsubscribing**
Subscriptions not properly unsubscribed cause memory leaks.

### Why It Is a Problem
Unsubscribed Observables keep running, causing memory leaks and performance degradation.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using the `takeUntil` pattern or Angular's `AsyncPipe` ensures Observables are properly terminated when no longer needed.

### Solution:
Use the `takeUntil` pattern:
```typescript
private destroy$ = new Subject<void>();

this.myService.getData()
  .pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy$))
  .subscribe();

ngOnDestroy() {
  this.destroy$.next();
  this.destroy$.complete();
}
```

---

## 5. **Not Leveraging Standalone Components**
Since Angular 14, standalone components simplify modularity but are often ignored.

### Why It Is a Problem
Ignoring standalone components results in unnecessarily large modules and reduced flexibility in reusing components.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Standalone components reduce module dependencies, simplify the codebase, and enhance modularity.

### Example:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-standalone',
  standalone: true,
  template: `<h1>Standalone Component</h1>`
})
export class StandaloneComponent {}
```

---

## 6. **Improper Change Detection**
Triggering unnecessary re-renders due to poor understanding of Angular’s change detection.

### Why It Is a Problem
Unnecessary re-renders can lead to performance issues, especially in large applications.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using `OnPush` change detection optimizes performance by reducing the number of checks Angular performs.

### Solution:
Use `OnPush` for better performance:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  template: `...`
})
export class ExampleComponent {}
```

---

## 7. **Hardcoding Environment-Specific Values**
Hardcoding API URLs or environment variables creates maintenance issues.

### Why It Is a Problem
Changing environment-specific values requires manual code changes and increases the risk of errors.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using Angular’s environment files centralizes these values, making it easy to switch environments.

### Solution:
Use Angular’s environment files:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
};
```

---

## 8. **Ignoring Lazy Loading**
Loading all modules upfront increases the app’s initial load time.

### Why It Is a Problem
Large bundle sizes result in slower loading times and poorer user experience.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Lazy loading splits the application into smaller bundles, improving performance by loading only the required parts.

### Solution:
Implement lazy loading:
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }
];
```

---

## 9. **Direct DOM Manipulation**
Manipulating the DOM directly bypasses Angular’s rendering model, leading to unpredictable behavior.

### Why It Is a Problem
Direct DOM manipulation can break Angular’s internal mechanisms, making the application harder to debug and maintain.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using Angular’s `Renderer2` provides a safer, platform-agnostic way to manipulate the DOM.

### Solution:
Use `Renderer2`:
```typescript
constructor(private renderer: Renderer2) {}

this.renderer.setStyle(element, 'color', 'red');
```

---

## 10. **Overusing Components Instead of Directives**
Components are sometimes used for functionality that would be better suited to directives.

### Why It Is a Problem
Using components for small, reusable behavior adds unnecessary overhead and complexity.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Directives are lightweight and are the correct choice for extending existing DOM elements with behavior.

### Example:
Instead of creating a component for highlighting text:
```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private renderer: Renderer2, private el: ElementRef) {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'backgroundColor', 'yellow');
  }
}
```
Using `Renderer2` ensures that DOM manipulation is platform-agnostic and aligns with Angular’s rendering model.

---

## 11. **Not Using Dependency Injection Correctly**
Creating services with `new` instead of relying on Angular’s DI system.

### Why It Is a Problem
Manually creating services bypasses Angular’s dependency graph, making it harder to test and manage dependencies.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using Angular’s DI system promotes consistency, testability, and ensures proper lifecycle management.

### Bad Example:
```typescript
const myService = new MyService();
```
### Good Example:
```typescript
constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
```

---

## 12. **Poor Error Handling**
Not properly handling errors in HTTP requests.

### Why It Is a Problem
Uncaught errors lead to poor user experience and unexpected app crashes.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using RxJS operators like `catchError` ensures graceful error handling, improving user experience.

### Solution:
Use `catchError` with RxJS:
```typescript
this.http.get('/api/data')
  .pipe(catchError(err => of([])))
  .subscribe();
```

---

## 13. **Bloated Components**
Placing too much logic in components makes them hard to manage.

### Why It Is a Problem
Large components are difficult to read, test, and maintain.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Moving logic to services improves code reuse and maintainability.

### Solution:
Move logic to services:
```typescript
@Component({...})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
  fetchData() {
    this.myService.getData().subscribe();
  }
}
```

---

## 14. **Not Optimizing for Production**
Deploying without building for production results in larger bundle sizes.

### Why It Is a Problem
Non-optimized builds increase load times and use more resources.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Building for production optimizes code and assets, improving performance and user experience.

### Solution:
Use:
```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

---

## 15. **Global Styles Leakage**
Not encapsulating styles properly can lead to conflicts.

### Why It Is a Problem
Unscoped styles can unintentionally affect unrelated components.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using Angular’s scoped styles keeps styles isolated to their respective components.

### Solution:
Use Angular’s `:host` and `:host-context` selectors:
```css
:host {
  display: block;
}
```

---

## 16. **Ignoring Accessibility**
Not considering accessibility impacts the usability for all users.

### Why It Is a Problem
Applications that are not accessible exclude users with disabilities, limiting the potential audience.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Adding accessibility features ensures inclusivity and compliance with legal standards.

### Example:
Add `aria-label`:
```html
<button aria-label="Submit form">Submit</button>
```

---

## 17. **Ignoring Testing**
Skipping unit tests and e2e tests leads to fragile code.

### Why It Is a Problem
Lack of tests increases the risk of introducing bugs and makes refactoring dangerous.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Writing tests ensures code stability, reliability, and confidence during updates.

### Example Test:
```typescript
it('should create the component', () => {
  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);
  expect(fixture.componentInstance).toBeTruthy();
});
```

---

## 18. **Overfetching Data**
Fetching unnecessary data wastes bandwidth and slows apps.

### Why It Is a Problem
Overfetching increases load times and can overwhelm users with irrelevant information.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using pagination or filters minimizes data transfer and improves user experience.

### Solution:
Use pagination or filters:
```typescript
this.http.get('/api/items', { params: { limit: '10', offset: '0' } });
```

---

## 19. **Not Using TrackBy in ngFor**
Failing to use `trackBy` can cause unnecessary DOM updates.

### Why It Is a Problem
Without `trackBy`, Angular recreates DOM elements unnecessarily, impacting performance.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using `trackBy` reduces DOM manipulations, improving rendering performance.

### Example:
```html
<div *ngFor="let item of items; trackBy: trackById">
  {{ item.name }}
</div>

trackById(index: number, item: any): number {
  return item.id;
}
```

---

## 20. **Inconsistent Folder Structure**
An unorganized project structure makes maintenance harder.

### Why It Is a Problem
Inconsistent structures confuse developers and make it harder to locate files.

### Why the Alternative Is Better
Using a consistent and feature-based structure improves scalability and developer productivity.

### Recommended Structure:
```
src/
  app/
    components/
    services/
    modules/
```

### Feature-Based Project Layout:
For larger applications, a feature-based layout promotes modularity and scalability by integrating standalone components and NgRx feature stores.

### Example Structure:
```
src/
  app/
    features/
      feature1/
        components/
          example.component.ts
        services/
          example.service.ts
        store/
          feature1.actions.ts
          feature1.reducer.ts
          feature1.selectors.ts
        feature1.module.ts
        feature1-routing.module.ts
      feature2/
        components/
          another.component.ts
        services/
          another.service.ts
        store/
          feature2.actions.ts
          feature2.reducer.ts
          feature2.selectors.ts
        feature2.module.ts
        feature2-routing.module.ts
    shared/
      components/
        shared.component.ts
      directives/
        shared.directive.ts
      pipes/
        shared.pipe.ts
      services/
        shared.service.ts
    core/
      interceptors/
        auth.interceptor.ts
      guards/
        auth.guard.ts
      core.module.ts
```

### Benefits:
- **Modularity:** Each feature is self-contained, simplifying development and testing.
- **State Management:** Each feature can have its own NgRx feature store, improving state isolation and reusability.
- **Scalability:** Promotes maintainability as the application grows.
- **Reusability:** Shared components, directives, and services are centralized for consistency.
