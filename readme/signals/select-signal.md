# Using `selectSignal` with NgRx and Angular Signals

When using `this.store.selectSignal()` in Angular with NgRx, the `selectSignal` method provides a signal-based wrapper for a state selector, which is part of Angular's reactive primitives introduced with signals. Here's how it works internally and answers your questions about observables and subscriptions.

---

## What Happens Behind the Scenes?

### 1. **Selector Conversion**
The `selectSignal` method internally calls the `select` method on the store, which produces an RxJS `Observable` of the selected state.

### 2. **Signal Creation**
Angular converts the emitted values from this `Observable` into a **signal**, which is a reactive primitive in Angular. This allows the component to track state changes declaratively without needing RxJS subscriptions.

### 3. **Unsubscription Handling**
The `selectSignal` method ensures that the `Observable` created from `select` is subscribed to and that this subscription is managed automatically by Angular.
- When the component or directive using the `selectSignal` method is destroyed, Angular takes care of tearing down the subscription to the `Observable`.

---

## Is an RxJS Observable Created?

Yes, an RxJS `Observable` is created internally by the `select` method of the store. However:

- You don't interact with this `Observable` directly.
- The conversion from the `Observable` to a signal is seamless and efficient.

---

## How Is the Subscription Managed?

The lifecycle of the `Observable` subscription is tied to the Angular **Signal** infrastructure:

- The signal is tracked as part of Angular's reactive context, which means that Angular is aware of dependencies on the signal.
- When the signal is no longer needed (e.g., the component is destroyed), Angular automatically unsubscribes from the internal `Observable`.

This is achieved through the **zone-less reactivity system** introduced in Angular with signals. Angular ensures that there are no memory leaks by cleaning up subscriptions.

## Benefits of `selectSignal`

### 1. **No Manual Subscriptions**
You don't need to explicitly manage or unsubscribe from the `Observable`. Signals handle this for you.

### 2. **Improved Performance**
Signals offer more granular reactivity than RxJS, which means that only dependent views are updated when the signal's state changes.

### 3. **Simplified Code**
Signals integrate naturally into Angular templates without requiring `.pipe()` or `| async`.

## Example in Action

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { selectAllTodos } from './todo.selectors';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-todo-list',
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <div *ngFor="let todo of todos$()">
      {{ todo.title }}
    </div>
  `,
})
export class TodoListComponent {
  todos$ = this.store.selectSignal(selectAllTodos);

  constructor(private store: Store) {}
}
```

### Explanation
- The `selectSignal` method automatically converts the `selectAllTodos` state into a signal.
- Angular tracks the `todos$` signal and automatically triggers updates when the state changes.
- No manual subscriptions or unsubscriptions are needed.

## Final Notes

- **Observable Creation:** An RxJS `Observable` is created internally by `selectSignal`.
- **Unsubscription:** The subscription is automatically managed by Angular when the component or directive is destroyed.
- **Efficiency:** Signals reduce boilerplate code and provide a more declarative way to manage reactive state in Angular.
